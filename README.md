Deep dive into designing patterns for the first time

1. Singleton

One of the most familiar pattern. Its role is to create one and only one instance of the class. We use static variable 
and method, so those are not linked with any particular object of class. We use private constructor and and private varbiale singleton, so address
cannot be changed to different after first creation.
